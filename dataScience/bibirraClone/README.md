# Spirit Label Content Based Image Retrieval
Using [BiBirra](https://towardsdatascience.com/bibirra-beer-label-recognition-8546c233d6f4) as a reference create a Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system that uses SIFT, SURF or an open source alternative to extract the key features from an image and using these key features identifies the closest reference image to a given query image.
The referenceImages folder contains one image for over seven hundred spirits, use these as the image database and feel free to add additional images to increase accuracy.
The queryImages folder contains images run through a bottle detector model, use these images to test the CBIR system.
