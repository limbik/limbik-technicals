# Full Stack Movies & People App
Create an application using a React based frontend client, a Javascript based backend server, and a Neo4j database. 

Setting up the Neo4j:
1. Go to https://sandbox.neo4j.com/
2. Start a project based on the “Movies” dataset
3. Open the sandbox and complete the tutorial

Note: There are connection instructions for Javascript in the details section of your sandbox

The App should:
- Have a movie selector dropdown populated with all movies in the Neo4j instance listed
- Have a date range slider that will update the list based on movies released between the 2 years selected
- Use the selected movie to find all the people associated with it and how they are connected to the movie in question
- Display the people and their relationships to the movie in a table
- Allow the table to be filtered based on the type of relationship
- Clicking on a row in the table loads a new page showing a table with all the movies the person is related to and their relationship with the movie, as well as the release year of the movie (Note: there should be a way to return to the movie table without browser controls)

You will need to upload your project and any code you used to a public GitHub repo complete with a read me that explains how to run your project. Also include in the read me any packages you used and a description about why you used each one.

Once done we ask that you send us the GitHub link to your project for us to review and we will be in touch about setting up an opportunity for you to go over you code with us and demonstrate in the running program how you met the requirements.

Keep in mind that the assignment is open ended by design to help us get a sense of how you think through problems. That said, should you need clarification on the assignment feel free to contact us.

Good Luck and look forward to seeing your awesome code!
