# Spirit Labels Content Based Image Retrieval
Using [BiBirra](https://towardsdatascience.com/bibirra-beer-label-recognition-8546c233d6f4) as an example create a Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system that identifies the closest reference image to a given query image.
The referenceImages folder contains one image for over seven hundred spirits use these as the image database and feel free to add additional images to increase accuracy.
